## Overview
The FAQ Search System allows users to query a set of frequently asked questions (FAQs) and receive relevant answers based on semantic similarity. It uses embeddings generated by a DistilBERT model and stores them in a Pinecone index for efficient retrieval.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages:
  - `fastapi`
  - `uvicorn`
  - `pinecone`
  - `transformers`
  - `torch`
  - `dotenv`
  - `fuzzywuzzy`
  - `sentence-transformers`
  - `nltk`
  
Make sure to install the required packages using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
